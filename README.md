**Identifying Honey Bees: Image Processing and Machine Learning**



Using images taken from beespotter.org, can we help scientists to 
identify Apis(Honey bee) or Bombus(Bumble bee).  
  
Being such important pollinators and the source of honey, it's important to help protect the dwindling population of bees in anyway we can.
